Task 01. Symmetric difference.

Time limit: 2 seconds
Memory limit: 64 megabytes
The input is a set of numbers in the range from 1 to 20000, separated by a space. They form a set A. Then there is a separator - the number 0 and a set of numbers B, separated by a space, is fed to the input, 0 is a sign of the end of the description of the set (not included in the set). It is necessary to derive the set ADV - the symmetric difference of the sets A and B in ascending order of elements. Use a space as a separator. If the set is empty, output 0.

Task 2. Sorting by many fields

Time limit: 2 seconds
Memory limit: 64 megabytes
The database stores N records of the type (Name, a1, a2, ..., ak) – all records have the same number of parameters. The priority of the fields is given to the input of the task – a permutation on the numbers 1, ..., k - records must be output by non-growth in accordance with this priority. If the priority of the fields is as follows: 3 4 2 1, then it should be perceived as follows: the priority of values from column 3 is the highest, the priority of values from column 4 is lower, the priority of values from column 2 is even lower, and the priority of values from column 1 is the lowest
